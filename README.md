# SSHD Tools

This repository contains tools to help with understanding the code of The
Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD.

Below is a summary of what each tool does. Please refer to the `README` within
each tool's directory for more information about how to use each tool.

## Tools

### Cheat Table

The cheat table is for use with Cheat Engine. It is meant to function
similarly to how Dolphin Memory Engine (DME) works for the Wii version of the
game. It can be used to view and modify key game values while the game is
running.

### Object Analyser

This is a script to help analyse the different objects with in the game. It
uses the [skywardsword-tools] `output` files to provide a way to compare the
different attributes of objects. It is inspired by
[zeldex](https://github.com/elijah-thomas774)'s tool for
[param parsing](https://github.com/elijah-thomas774/SkywardSwordParamsScripts).
